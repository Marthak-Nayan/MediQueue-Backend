# MediQueue 🏥

MediQueue is a **self-initiated backend project** built to gain hands-on experience in designing secure and scalable RESTful APIs using **Java and Spring Boot**. The project focuses on solving a real-world problem—**managing patient queues in healthcare environments**—while applying industry-standard backend practices.

This project was developed purely for **self-learning purposes** to strengthen my understanding of backend development, authentication mechanisms, and database integration.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The main objective of MediQueue is to:

* Understand real-world backend application design
* Implement secure authentication and authorization
* Build clean and structured REST APIs
* Work with relational databases using JPA

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* Secure user authentication using **JWT (JSON Web Token)**
* Role-based access control using **Spring Security**
* RESTful APIs for managing patients and queue flow
* Backend logic for patient queue handling
* Persistent data storage with **PostgreSQL**
* API testing and validation using **Postman**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Java
* **Framework:** Spring Boot
* **Security:** Spring Security, JWT
* **Data Access:** Spring Data JPA
* **API Style:** RESTful APIs
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **API Testing:** Postman
* **Build Tool:** Maven
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

---

## ⚙️ How It Works (Backend Overview)

* Client sends authentication requests to REST endpoints
* JWT is generated and validated for secured APIs
* Spring Security filters protect sensitive routes
* Business logic is handled in service layers
* Data is persisted and retrieved using JPA repositories

This structure follows standard **industry-level backend architecture**.

## 📌 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained practical experience in:

* Building RESTful APIs using Spring Boot
* Implementing JWT-based authentication
* Securing applications with Spring Security
* Designing clean service and repository layers
* Working with PostgreSQL using JPA and Hibernate
* Testing APIs using Postman
